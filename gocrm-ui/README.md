## Key Components

### Authentication
- JWT-based authentication with automatic token refresh
- Role-based access control (Admin, Sales, Support, Customer)
- Protected routes based on user permissions

### Dashboard
- Real-time statistics from backend API
- Quick action buttons for common tasks
- Responsive stat cards showing:
  - Total leads and customers
  - Open tickets and pending tasks
  - Lead conversion rate

### Data Management
- **Leads**: Lead tracking and conversion to customers
- **Customers**: Customer lifecycle management
- **Tickets**: Support ticket system with assignments
- **Tasks**: Task management with due dates and priorities
- **Users**: User management (admin only)

### Configuration Management
- Dynamic configuration system
- Category-based settings organization
- Real-time updates without restart
- Type-safe configuration editing

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the GopherCRM backend through RESTful APIs:

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration

### Data Endpoints
- Leads: `/api/leads/*`
- Customers: `/api/customers/*`
- Tickets: `/api/tickets/*`
- Tasks: `/api/tasks/*`
- Users: `/api/users/*`
- Configurations: `/api/configurations/*`
- Dashboard: `/api/dashboard/stats`

### Error Handling
- Consistent error response format
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry for failed requests
- Loading states and error boundaries

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow React functional component patterns
- Use Material-UI components and theme system
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Write tests for complex logic

### Testing
- Unit tests for utilities and hooks
- Component tests for UI interactions
- Integration tests for API calls
- Maintain test coverage above 80%

### Performance
- Lazy loading for route components
- Efficient API data caching with TanStack Query
- Optimized bundle splitting
- Image optimization

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The application uses environment variables for configuration:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080  # Backend API URL
```

### Theme Customization
Customize the Material-UI theme in `src/theme/index.ts`:

```typescript
export const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#1976d2',
    },
    // ... other theme options
  },
});
```

## Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY dist/ /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
```

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code style and patterns
2. Write tests for new features
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Ensure TypeScript compilation passes
5. Test responsiveness across devices

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build Errors**
- Check TypeScript errors: `npm run type-check`
- Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies

**API Connection Issues**
- Verify backend server is running on port 8080
- Check CORS configuration in backend
- Confirm API endpoints in network tab

**Authentication Issues**
- Clear localStorage tokens
- Check JWT token expiration
- Verify backend authentication middleware
