## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Test Infrastructure
- Enhanced test setup with proper Vitest configuration
- Created comprehensive test utilities with all necessary providers
- Implemented mock data factories for consistent test data

### 2. Component Fixes
- Added `data-testid="loading"` to Loading component for better test accessibility
- Fixed test selectors to work with Material-UI components
- Updated tests to handle async loading states properly

### 3. Test Patterns Established
- Use ARIA roles for finding interactive elements
- Handle MUI Select components by position when multiple exist
- Wait for data to load before interacting with components
- Use regex patterns for text matching to handle dynamic content

## Known Issues
- **Linting**: 7 errors and 49 warnings remain (mostly related to `any` types and non-null assertions)
- **More Menu Actions**: Some components have menu actions that aren't fully wired up

## Next Steps
1. Add tests for remaining components (Tasks, Users)
2. Fix remaining linting errors
3. Add integration tests for API interactions
4. Consider adding visual regression tests
5. Set up continuous integration to run tests automatically
