# Ticket Test Suite Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive test suite created for the Ticket entity in the GoCRM application.

## Overview

Created test suites for two main components:
- **TicketList.test.tsx** - 19 tests covering the ticket list functionality
- **TicketForm.test.tsx** - 18 tests covering ticket creation and editing

### Form Interactions (3 tests)
- ✅ Disables submit button while processing

- ✅ Allows selecting all status values in edit mode

## Key Testing Patterns Used

1. **Mock Setup**: Comprehensive mocking of API endpoints and navigation
2. **User Interactions**: Using `userEvent` for realistic user interactions
3. **Async Handling**: Proper use of `waitFor` for async operations
4. **Error Handling**: Testing both success and failure scenarios
5. **Edge Cases**: Testing empty states, loading states, and error states
6. **Accessibility**: Using accessible queries (getByRole, getByLabelText, etc.)

## Test Coverage Areas

- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **Filtering & Search**: Multiple filter combinations
- **Pagination**: Page navigation and rows per page
- **Form Validation**: Required fields and data validation
- **User Interactions**: Clicks, form inputs, selections
- **API Integration**: Success and error responses
- **Navigation**: Route changes and redirects
- **State Management**: Loading states, error states, empty states

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all ticket tests
npm test -- src/pages/tickets/TicketList.test.tsx src/pages/tickets/TicketForm.test.tsx

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- src/pages/tickets/TicketList.test.tsx src/pages/tickets/TicketForm.test.tsx --watch

# Run with coverage
npm test -- src/pages/tickets/TicketList.test.tsx src/pages/tickets/TicketForm.test.tsx --coverage
```

## Notes

- Tests follow the same patterns as the Lead test suite for consistency
- All tests are isolated and don't depend on each other
- Mock data uses factory functions for consistency
- Tests cover both happy paths and error scenarios
- Focus on user behavior rather than implementation details
