# Test Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TestEmailUniqueness - Fixed User ID Issue
**Problem**: The test was trying to update user ID 3 but that user doesn't exist since IDs are auto-incremented.
**Solution**: The test already creates users dynamically and uses their actual IDs (user2.ID), so this wasn't the actual issue.

### 2. TestUserCRUD - Fixed Permission and Data Issues
**Problem**: 
- Update response was returning nil data
- Delete was getting 403 Forbidden error
- The admin token didn't have the correct permissions

**Root Cause**: 
The middleware was setting `user_role` as `models.UserRole` type (line 41 in auth.go), but the handler was comparing it as a string (line 146 in user_handler.go). This type mismatch caused the permission checks to fail.

### 3. Permission System Fix
**Solution**: 
Modified the middleware to store the role as a string and handle the conversion properly:

1. In `internal/middleware/auth.go`:
   - Changed `c.Set("user_role", user.Role)` to `c.Set("user_role", string(user.Role))` 
   - Updated RequireRole to convert the string back: `currentRole := models.UserRole(userRole.(string))`

This ensures consistent type handling throughout the permission system.

## Test Results
All integration tests are now passing:
- TestEmailUniqueness ✓
- TestMeEndpoints ✓
- TestPermissionEnforcement ✓
- TestProtectedRoutes ✓
- TestUserCRUD ✓
- TestUserLogin ✓
- TestUserRegistration ✓

The update response now correctly returns user data and the delete operation works with proper admin permissions.
